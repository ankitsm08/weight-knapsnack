    <p class="center">Made with 💪 and a little Indian jugaad</p>

        <h2>Hey there 👋</h2>
        <p>I'm <strong>Ank</strong>, a STEM student and home workout enthusiast who got tired of guessing how much my
            backpack full of bottles actually weighed. So, instead of buying fancy adjustable weights, I decided to make
            my own “smart” solution.</p>

        <h2>What is Knapsnack?</h2>

            you the most efficient way to load up without overthinking it.
